        <h2>Smoked Jollof Rice!</h2>

        <p>Fresh pot of delicious, <em>smoked</em> jollof rice served with fried chicken and beef.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Two medium tomatoes, roughly chopped</li>
            <li>Scotch bonnet pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 medium onion, roughly chopped</li>
            <li>3 small red bell peppers, roughly chopped</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon each of curry & garlic powder</li>
            <li>2 1/2 cups of medium-grain rice</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>In a blender, combine tomatoes, scotch bonnet pepper and onions; purée. Pour out half the purée into a bowl; set aside. Add the bell peppers to the purée remaining in the blender and pulse until smooth. Add to the mixture that was set aside and stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add blended vegetables along with the salt, curry powder, ground chile pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, bay leaves, ginger and thyme. Bring mixture to a boil.</li>
            <li>Stir in the rice until well mixed, then reduce the heat to low.</li>
            <li>Cover pot and let cook until rice is al dente, about 45 minutes. Check after 30 minutes; if rice is sauce-logged, remove the lid to cook off the excess sauce. If rice seems dry, stir in 1 to 2 cups water. Allow the rice at the bottom of the pot to char a bit to infuse it with a smoky flavor.</li>
        </ol>
